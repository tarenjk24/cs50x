        <h2 class="font-weight-light"> Week 0:</h2>
        <p> The first lecture of CS50 Scratch left quite an impression on me. It was a great learning opportunity in both educational and entertainment aspects. Scratch was a unique way to start learning to code. I admit I had some problems at the beginning making an interactive story; hence, I decided to create more of a straightforward game instead. One of my favorite scratch features was that I could share my work with my friends so they could try it. &nbsp; <img src="scratch.png" class="pic" />

        <h2 class="font-weight-light"> Week 1-5:</h2>
        </p>
        <p> After starting from scratch, I started learning C and worked on it for the next five weeks. The week began with simple syntax and manageable problems, working with loops, which I learned from scratch, and different variable types like integers. Another important thing that I learned was to make sure your code looked clear and clean. First, your code has to be clear to other programmers by adding comments explaining each block of code. Second, keep your code clean, as in well-organized, so other programmers can understand your work. I learned to do both using "style 50.". <img src="c1.png" class="pic" />

        <h2 class="font-weight-light"> Week 6:</h2>
        </p>
        <p> I was excited to start working with Python, especially after being stuck on the Week 5 problem for a while. Python was way more direct than C. It was the simple things that made a difference. Such as less syntax, which means you can write the same C problems in fewer lines. Therefore, week number six was a quick and fun experience. <img src="p.png" class="pic" />
        </p> &nbsp; <h2 class="font-weight-light"> Week 7:</h2>
        <p> SQL served a different purpose than software development. It was essentially for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases. I learned how to work with data to solve the problems of week 7. <img src="sql.png" class="pic" />
        </p> &nbsp; <h2 class="font-weight-light"> Week 8:</h2>
        <p> This week I learned how to use HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Web development is different from software development in that it takes more time to create a presentable project that is also functional. As I am working on the week eight problem, I am doing plenty of research to figure out what tags, pictures, and styles to use for my home page. </p>
