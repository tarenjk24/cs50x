        <h2 class="font-weight-light" style="color:white;"> This is my rank list of CS50 labs and problems, from easiest to hardest:</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="list">

        <ol>
          <li>Week 7 (songs, movies) :</li>
          <p>Week 7 for me was one of the easiest weeks. SQL is a straightforward language.</p>
          <li>scratch week 0 :</li>
          <p>Some people may find it strange that I didn't rank scratch in first place, which is understandable, but it took me some time to understand and implement the problem requirements, hence why it is number 3.</p>
          <li>fiftyville week 7 :</li>
          <p>fiftyville was in week 7 it was more time consuming than songs and movies.</p>
          <li>python labs and problems week 6 :</li>
          <p>Week 6 problems were simple because I used Python. Campared to C, Python is more manageable.</p>
          <li>trivia week 8 :</li>
          <p>Week 8 lab Trivia was also easy, even for beginners.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <p>

          <h2  class="font-weight-light" style="color:white;">And now C. C is in a category of its own because it was a new language to me, so I took some time learning its syntax. </h2>
